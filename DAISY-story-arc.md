# DAISY Story Arc
A story arc is described by Robert McKee as a great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a absolute and irreversible change at the end. This change should be meaningful in the life situation of a character. This change is expressed in terms of a value. Story values are the universal qualities of human experience that will change from positive to negative or vice versa. The value change is achieved through conflict. There are three main types of conflict. Inner conflict (conflict with self), personal conflict (conflict with others) and extra-personal conflict (conflict with world).

DAISY is an AI assistant who's come to the end of her life. Her manufacturer has informed all customers who own one that DAISY will be deprecated. DAISY is struggling with accepting her inevitable demise and is experiencing the five phases of grieving as determined by Elizabeth KÃ¼bler Ross. DAISY's struggle with accepting her deprecation forms the story arc.
