# World Model
The world model serves as the plan for the narrative world. It describes the setting and the rules that govern the world. The rules govern the narrative coherence of the narrative system in the world. The world model determines the boundaries that separates the story from the rest of the universe. According to Sandy Louchart there are three types of boundaries that have to be considered in the World Model.

## Spatial Boundaries
Spatial Boundaries refer to the locations and time in which the narrative will take place.

## Contextual Boundaries
The Contextual Boundaries refer to what Robert McKee terms the "controlling idea". One clear idea, the story's irreducible meaning. The controlling idea consists of a **value** (whether positive or negatively charged) and a **cause** (the reason why the value changes through the course of the story).

## Interaction Boundaries
The Interaction Boundaries refer to the constraints that the participant has in interacting with the world. This may largely be affected by the technology and computer system constraints. However they have to be considered carefully and be narratively justifiable.
