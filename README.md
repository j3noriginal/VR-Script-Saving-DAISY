## What is the Project?

This project is a working progress VR script as part of a Masters Degree program at [AFDA](https://www.afda.co.za/) I set out to understand how storytelling would work in the VR medium. In my thesis I explore the topic of emergent storytelling where conflict is the progressive driving force of narrative. I will now apply the recommended conceptual model and create the proposed artefacts to author a virtual reality narrative.


### Abstract
My paper deals with the issue of virtual reality as a developing narrative medium wherein a viewer is a participant. Various authors indicate that interactivity breaks the predetermined sequence of narrative, therefore, a participant’s agency in virtual reality narrative creates tension between his/her own freedom to act and what is deemed to be an adequate narrative experience. However, interactivity is unique to the medium and generally favoured over the participant being constrained to the role of passive observer.

Fully interactive virtual reality narrative is essential in this medium, as it enhances presence and remediates older mediums to tell new stories. In my paper I theorise that conflict is the necessary progressive force that can harness a participant’s agency to create interesting narrative experiences. Through analysis of Robert McKee’s (1941) model of the three levels of narrative conflict and the capacity of different narrative mediums to engender each level respectively, I propose that the tension between agency and narrative is a potential level of narrative conflict between participant and narrator that can be utilised in virtual reality narrative. It is a conceptual model that can be utilised by the creator of virtual reality narrative that envisions a relationship of conflict with the participant to construct a narrative framework that is able to produce emergent virtual reality narrative.

## The Story

Through the actions and decisions of the participant, he/she will drive narrative and a unique story should emerge. The participant enters the world as a character who wakes up one morning and finds he cannot interact with his environment. He cannot pick up, move, or physically interact with the world. However, he can communicate and navigate the space.

## The Format
As part of this project you can download a [copy of my thesis](assets/downloads/Johanna-Rostoll-MFA-Thesis-OCT-2017.pdf). I will be developing the following artefacts:
* A World Model
* Narrated Scenario
* Character Models
