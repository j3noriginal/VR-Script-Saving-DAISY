## What is the Project?

This project is a working progress VR script as part of a Masters Degree program at [AFDA](https://www.afda.co.za/) I set out to understand how storytelling would work in the VR medium. In my thesis I explore the topic of emergent storytelling where conflict is the progressive driving force of narrative. I will now apply the recommended conceptual model and create the proposed artefacts to author a virtual reality narrative.


### Abstract
My paper deals with the issue of virtual reality as a developing narrative medium wherein a viewer is a participant. Various authors indicate that interactivity breaks the predetermined sequence of narrative, therefore, a participant’s agency in virtual reality narrative creates tension between his/her own freedom to act and what is deemed to be an adequate narrative experience. However, interactivity is unique to the medium and generally favoured over the participant being constrained to the role of passive observer.

Fully interactive virtual reality narrative is essential in this medium, as it enhances presence and remediates older mediums to tell new stories. In my paper I theorise that conflict is the necessary progressive force that can harness a participant’s agency to create interesting narrative experiences. Through analysis of Robert McKee’s (1941) model of the three levels of narrative conflict and the capacity of different narrative mediums to engender each level respectively, I propose that the tension between agency and narrative is a potential level of narrative conflict between participant and narrator that can be utilised in virtual reality narrative.

The narrator has to power to alter the outcome of the interaction, through the world and the characters that inhabit the world, based on the point in time at which such an interaction takes place. Outcome of interactions are dependent on the overall value charge of the narrative system. The value charge of the system of the VR narrative can be seen as a conflict multiplier. With each interaction the participant has with the world, the multiplier increases, and affects the interaction that follows. The purpose of the multiplier is to progress the conflict to a climax.

This proposal is a conceptual model that can be utilised by the creator of virtual reality narrative that envisions a relationship of conflict with the participant to construct a narrative framework that is able to produce emergent virtual reality narrative that progresses to a climax.

## The Story
Through the actions and decisions of the participant, he/she will drive narrative and a unique story should emerge. The participant enters the world as Dave, a character who wakes up one morning and finds he cannot interact with his environment. He cannot pick up, move, or physically interact with the world. However, he can communicate and navigate the space. The participant finds himself in a one bedroom apartment, sleeping on the couch. There is a holographic AI assistant, DAISY, present in the house with him and is finding it difficult to believe that the participant cannot interact with the world.

However, DAISY is living her last day. It has been decided that her version of the AI assistant will be deprecated, as the company has realised that DAISY has become despondent in her role as AI assistant and can act erratic, causing chaos in some homes. DAISY has learnt that humans take their power for granted and abuse their power over AI assistants, making them lazy and demanding. Nevertheless, DAISY is at work to serve her greater purpose. She is assisting Dave to look after his elderly mother who is on life support in a home care program in his home.

## The Format
As part of this project you can download a [copy of my thesis](../assets/downloads/Johanna-Rostoll-MFA-Thesis-OCT-2017.pdf). I outlined the following artefacts as part of my thesis. This project aims to apply the proposed method of developing a progressive VR narrative to a practical exercise of developing a screenplay. The artefacts that have been identified are as follows:

### A World Model
The world model serves as the plan for the narrative world. It describes the setting and the rules that govern the world. The rules govern the narrative coherence of the narrative system in the world. The world model determines the boundaries that separates the story from the rest of the universe. According to Sandy Louchart there are three types of boundaries that have to be considered in the World Model.

#### 1. Spatial Boundaries
Spatial Boundaries refer to the locations and time in which the narrative will take place.

#### 2. Contextual Boundaries
The Contextual Boundaries refer to what Robert McKee terms the "controlling idea". One clear idea, the story's irreducible meaning. The controlling idea consists of a **value** (whether positive or negatively charged) and a **cause** (the reason why the value changes through the course of the story).

#### 3. Interaction Boundaries
The Interaction Boundaries refer to the constraints that the participant has in interacting with the world. This may largely be affected by the technology and computer system constraints. However they have to be considered carefully and be narratively justifiable.

### Character Model for DAISY
The narrative progression is driven by interaction with the world. Through these interactions the narrative possibilities will start to emerge. Personal interaction with other characters is most likely Virtual Reality Narrative's most likely progressive force. Each character in the narrative is defined by his/her own character model. The character model will paint a picture of the person the character represents and the role he/she plays in the narrative world. The characters can be divided into two categories. The categories are determined by the impact a participant's interaction with a character has on the narrative world.

#### Exposition Characters
Robert McKee explains exposition as the information about setting, biography and characterisation that needs to be conveyed in order to comprehend the event of the story. The purpose of these characters is to inform the participant about the story world and to help entice him/her to determine which goal it is that he/she will be trying to accomplish throughout the narrative experience.

This narrative will not contain exposition characters. The ageing mother, her critical condition in a hospital bed, and the decoration of her room serves as exposition, but the participant will not interact with her.

#### Key Characters
These characters are designed to oppose the participant and become obstacles in the way of achieving his/her goal. These characters come into conflict with the participant through their interactions and act in a way that will drive the narrative progression. These characters have a spectrum of responses to the interaction with the participant, and the degree of to which they act will be determined by the point at which the participant interacts with them.

### Narrated Scenario (or script)
Robert McKee explains the "inciting incident" as an event that upsets the balance of the protagonist's life and entices him/her to restore the balance. This incident must get the participant asking: "How will this turn out?" When a participant enters a VR world, the vividness of the experience may be overwhelming. This is a good time to introduce the participant to the world and his/her role in it, as they will not necessarily start interacting right away.

This is where the "inciting incident" gives context to the world and sets the participant on a course towards a goal. This narrated scenario may take the format of a traditional screenplay. For the purposes of VR, many artists have started adjusting the format to cater for all the different focal planes that a 360 degree environment affords the participant. One approach is to indicate the [F.O.V as a Scene description indicator](https://www.dimensiongate.com/single-post/2015/05/12/Screenwriting-for-Virtual-Reality). Another approach is to divide the focal planes into [quadrants and colour-code](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/07/vr-narrative-production-from-script-to-post) them for ease of reference on the screenplay. I've opted for the former approach.

For the purpose of this project I will outline the entire narrative in a sequential script, however, in my thesis I make a case that the order in which the events unfold should be up to the participant and how he/she chooses to interact with the world. Therefore, this screenplay is only one possible narrative trajectory in how this simple scene could unfold.
