# The Inciting Incident
Robert McKee explains the "inciting incident" as an event that upsets the balance of the protagonist's life and entices him/her to restore the balance. This incident must get the participant asking: "How will this turn out?"

When a participant enters a VR world, the vividness of the experience may be overwhelming. This is a good time to introduce the participant to the world and his/her role in it, as they will not necessarily start interacting right away. This is where the "inciting incident" gives context to the world and sets the participant on a course towards a goal.
