<div class="action"><p>This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.</p></div>

<div class="action page-break"><p><strong>FADE IN:</strong></p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A RIVER.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>This is The Beast.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>There are some fish that cannot be caught.&nbsp; It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.&nbsp; They're just touched by something extra.&nbsp; Call it luck.&nbsp; Call it grace.&nbsp; One such fish was The Beast.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.&nbsp; Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.&nbsp; Past a swiping bear claw.&nbsp; The Beast isn't worried.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p><p>By the time I was born, he was already a legend.&nbsp; He'd taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.&nbsp;  Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)</h6>
<div class="action"><p>WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story.&nbsp; In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.&nbsp; All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.</p><p class="parenthetical">(closer)</p><p>And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)</h6>
<div class="action"><p>A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Now, I'd tried everything on it:&nbsp; worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.&nbsp; But on that day I had a revelation:&nbsp; if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work.&nbsp; I would have to use something he truly desired.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">LITTLE BRAVE</p><p class="parenthetical">(confused)</p><p>Your finger?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward slips his ring off.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Gold.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.&nbsp; He's heard this story before.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.&nbsp; She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma.&nbsp; He's hypnotizing.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.&nbsp; And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.&nbsp; His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You can see my predicament.&nbsp; My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>ON WILL AND SANDRA</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p class="parenthetical">(low but insistent)</p><p>Make him stop.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL'S DATE</p><p>What did you do?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.&nbsp; I looked him straight in the eye.&nbsp; And I made a remarkable discovery.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14&#194;&#176;) - NIGHT (1998)</h6>
<div class="action"><p>WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.&nbsp; This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.&nbsp; They should be joyful, but Will is furious.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.&nbsp; The room is cozy and drunk.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>This fish, the Beast.&nbsp; The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.&nbsp; It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.&nbsp; She looks gorgeous.&nbsp; She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Now, I was in a situation.&nbsp; I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will can't take any more.&nbsp; Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.&nbsp; Edward doesn't even notice.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?&nbsp; This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father--</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD AND WILL</p><p>We were part of the same equation.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Honey, it's still your night.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will can't articulate his anger.&nbsp; He just leaves.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?</p><p class="parenthetical">(closer; he holds up his ring)</p><p>That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He focuses his words on Sandra.&nbsp; This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A LAUGH from the crowd.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.&nbsp; As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.&nbsp; The crowd APPLAUDS.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward toasts the happy couple.&nbsp; Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; OUTSIDE LA RUE 14&#194;&#176; - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.&nbsp; Both men are a little drunk.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p class="parenthetical">(disbelieving)</p><p>I am a footnote in that story.&nbsp; I am the context for your great adventure.&nbsp; Which never happened!&nbsp; Incidentally!&nbsp; You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p class="parenthetical">(shaking his head)</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Friend of yours?&nbsp; Did you help him out of a bind?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Come on, Will.&nbsp; Everyone likes that story.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>No Dad, they don't.&nbsp; <u>I</u> do not like the story.&nbsp; Not anymore, not after a <u>thousand</u> <u>times</u>.&nbsp; I know all the punchlines, Dad.&nbsp; I can tell them as well as you can.</p><p class="parenthetical">(closer)</p><p>For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.&nbsp; It revolves around me and my wife.&nbsp; How can you not understand that?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A long beat, then...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p class="parenthetical">(low)</p><p>Sorry to embarrass you.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will won't let him get the last word.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.&nbsp; You just don't see it.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>ANGLE ON Edward.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; A hand to wave, enough of you.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He walks away.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.&nbsp; It's then we FREEZE FRAME.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p><p>After that night, I didn't speak to my father again for three years.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>A typically busy day.&nbsp; On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (ON PHONE)</p><p class="parenthetical">(without pauses)</p><p>William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He's put back on hold.&nbsp; Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.&nbsp; Rips it open.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p><p>We communicated indirectly I guess.&nbsp; In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)</p><p>When I'd call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.&nbsp; Or swimming in the pool.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>True to form, we never talked about our not talking.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Sandra stands by the window, watching as...</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward swims laps in the family pool.&nbsp; He's born to the water.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)</p><p>The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me.&nbsp; We were like strangers who knew each other very well.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; RIVER - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)</p><p>In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.&nbsp; The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water.&nbsp; As the water ripples past, something changes.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20's, staring into the water.&nbsp; He's not just handsome, not just charming.&nbsp; It's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>THE BEAST.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He brings the catfish up to his face.&nbsp; Looks it right in the eye.&nbsp; A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>But that's what kind of story this is.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>TITLE OVER:</p></div>
<div class="action centered"><p><u>BIG FISH</u></p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs.&nbsp; She's flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">YOUNG DR. BENNETT</p><p>Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to give me one good push.&nbsp; On three.&nbsp; One...</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands.&nbsp; Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.&nbsp; It shoots up into air.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.&nbsp; As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.&nbsp; Everyone races after it.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Bursting through the doors --</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">YOUNG DR. BENNETT</p><p>Grab that baby!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.&nbsp; Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (V.O.)</p><p>My father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.&nbsp; No longer than most men's, but larger.&nbsp; And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.&nbsp; By the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.&nbsp; A cradle is still in its carton.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>KEYS in the lock.&nbsp; LAUGHTER in the hallway.&nbsp; The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.&nbsp; His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>Allo oui?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.&nbsp; He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)</p><p class="parenthetical">(on phone)</p><p>Yes, he's here.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>She hands the phone to Will, concerned.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE (CONT'D)</p><p>It's your mother.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Half-stripped, Will takes the phone.&nbsp; This won't be good news.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p class="parenthetical">(on phone)</p><p>Hi.&nbsp; Uh-huh.&nbsp; Uh-huh.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.&nbsp; She listens carefully to Will's side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL (CONT'D)</p><p>What does Dr. Bennett say?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; No, sure, let me talk to him.&nbsp;  I'll wait.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He covers the mouthpiece.&nbsp; Looks over to Josephine.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>It's bad.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>It's more than they thought.&nbsp; They're going to stop chemo.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>You need to go.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Probably tonight.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A beat.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>I'm going with you.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>You don't have to.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p class="parenthetical">(a simple fact)</p><p>I'm going with you.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.&nbsp; Will has a window seat in coach.&nbsp; Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.&nbsp; There's an effortless intimacy between them.&nbsp; She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; 747 / FLYING - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.&nbsp; Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.&nbsp; Her head is propped against Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.&nbsp; A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.&nbsp;  The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)</p><p>So which one's it gonna be?&nbsp; The Monkey in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Focusing on the final shadow, we...</p></div>

<h6>INT.&nbsp; BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>...come to find Edward making the shapes.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him.&nbsp; The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>The one about the witch.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore.&nbsp; You get nightmares.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>I'm not scared.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.&nbsp; He then leans in, complicitous.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Neither was I.&nbsp; At first.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.&nbsp; Kids weren't supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.&nbsp; But there were five of us out there that night:&nbsp; Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive.&nbsp; The moon hangs low, casting long shadows.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Five kids walk past in silhouette.&nbsp; Four have flashlights on.&nbsp; The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>Now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.&nbsp; Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically creepy house:&nbsp; its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half-buried in the dirt.&nbsp; Even bats are afraid to fly over it.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister.&nbsp; Who knows what is lurking in the shadows?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p><p>Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared.&nbsp; For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Edward drops down on the far side of the gate.&nbsp; Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement.&nbsp; They get the hell out of there.&nbsp; Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar.</p></div>
<h6>EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door.&nbsp; Anything could jump out of them.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He steps on the porch.&nbsp; The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on.&nbsp; A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.&nbsp; Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.&nbsp; Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>RINGS THE DOORBELL.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye.&nbsp; She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p class="parenthetical">(calm and straightforward)</p><p>Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there's some folks'd like to see your eye.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Edward helps her back inside.&nbsp; He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I was thinking about death and all.&nbsp; About seeing how you're gonna die.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up.&nbsp; But it could kind of help you, couldn't it?&nbsp; Because you'd know that everything else you can survive.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.&nbsp; And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>This time we don't cut.&nbsp; Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.&nbsp; He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.&nbsp; Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys.&nbsp; His future has something strange in store.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Huh.&nbsp; That's how I go?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The Old Woman nods.&nbsp; Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns and leaves.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>From that moment on, I no longer feared death.&nbsp; And for that, I was as good as immortal.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>He leans in and hugs her.&nbsp; She surrenders, squeezing her son tight.&nbsp; Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical.&nbsp; They've always been close.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>I'm so glad you're here.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time:&nbsp; an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot.&nbsp; KIDS are playing on the street.</p></div>

<h6>INT.&nbsp; GUEST ROOM - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed.&nbsp; Although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared.&nbsp; The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.&nbsp; He tries to say something, but no words come out.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.&nbsp; Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself.&nbsp; A very long, tense beat.&nbsp; Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Finally...</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Did you do any of that?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>No, but I hear it's terrible.&nbsp; Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You learned from the best.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Just drink half the can.&nbsp; I'll tell her you drank the whole thing.&nbsp; Everyone wins.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Surprise ending.&nbsp; Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, then pushes the can away.&nbsp; He swallows with difficulty.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>I'd just like to know the true versions of things.&nbsp; Events.&nbsp; Stories.&nbsp; You.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH.&nbsp; The HACKING escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.&nbsp; It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I was never much for being at home, Will.&nbsp; It's too confining.&nbsp; And this, here.&nbsp; Being stuck in bed.&nbsp; Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>I thought you weren't dying.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I said this isn't how I go.&nbsp; The last part is much more unusual.&nbsp; Trust me on that.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>He pulls at his collar.&nbsp; Then pulls again, his face getting red.&nbsp; Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.&nbsp; He's starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.&nbsp; Two more buttons fly off.&nbsp; One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.</p></div>

<h6>EXT.&nbsp; HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave.&nbsp; Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant's feast:&nbsp; broken barrels, bones picked clean.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Hello!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>There's no answer.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD&nbsp; (CONT'D)</p><p>My name is Edward Bloom!&nbsp; I want to talk to you!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">VOICE (O.S.)</p><p>GO AWAY!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair back.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I'm not going anywhere until you show yourself.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming.&nbsp; Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's going to take.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.&nbsp; Even Edward starts to worry.&nbsp; Just how big is this guy?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p><p>Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn't kill me.&nbsp; All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.&nbsp; Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen.&nbsp; Not just tall, but massive.&nbsp; He's completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.&nbsp; What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.&nbsp; God knows what's living in his matted hair.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.&nbsp; Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.&nbsp; The giant didn't even notice it.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>Why are you here?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward ponders the best response, settling on...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>So you can eat me.&nbsp; The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl's eyes narrow, confused.&nbsp; Edward stands up.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>My arms are a little stringy, but there's some good eating on my legs.&nbsp; I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them myself.</p><p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p><p>So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.&nbsp; Because I'm not much for pain, really.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.&nbsp; Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.&nbsp; Relieved to see he's not licking his chops --</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Look, I can't go back.&nbsp; I'm a human sacrifice.&nbsp; If I go back, everyone will think I'm a coward.&nbsp; And I'd rather be dinner than a coward.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Here, start with my hand.&nbsp; It'll be an appetizer.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth.&nbsp; But the giant spits it back out.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>I don't want to eat you.&nbsp; I don't want to eat anybody.&nbsp; It's just I get so hungry.&nbsp; I'm too big.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>And that's the sad truth.&nbsp; Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward takes a seat beside him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Did you ever think maybe you're not too big?&nbsp; Maybe this town's just too small.&nbsp; I mean, look at it.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Hardly two stories in the whole place.&nbsp; Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>Really?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Wouldn't lie to you.&nbsp; And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets.&nbsp; You can eat a lot, can't you?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>I can.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>So why are you wasting your time in a small town?&nbsp; You're a big man.&nbsp; You should be in the big city.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl smiles, but then it fades.&nbsp; A certain sad suspicion --</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you?&nbsp; That's why they sent you here.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>What's your name, Giant?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>Karl.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Mine's Edward.&nbsp; And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl.&nbsp; But I want to leave with you.</p><p class="parenthetical">(closer)</p><p>You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition.&nbsp; I can't see staying here a day longer.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>You don't like it?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I love every square inch of it.&nbsp; But I can feel the edges closing in on me.&nbsp; A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.</p><p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p><p>So what do you say?&nbsp; Join me?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl thinks a moment.&nbsp; Then --</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>Okay.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Okay.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>They shake on it.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; RIVER - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl.&nbsp; There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MAYOR</p><p class="parenthetical">(loudly, for the crowd)</p><p>Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go.&nbsp; But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.&nbsp; The crowd CHEERS.&nbsp; And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go.&nbsp; He crushes his cigarette under his heel.&nbsp; He wishes he could crush Edward.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">VARIOUS TOWNFOLK</p><p>Find yourself a nice girl!&nbsp; Don't trust anyone in Kentucky!&nbsp; Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>THE OLD WOMAN.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.&nbsp; She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.&nbsp; Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p class="parenthetical">(to the Old Woman)</p><p>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward and Karl keep walking.&nbsp; The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>What did she say?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Beats me.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; ROAD - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.&nbsp; Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't.&nbsp; People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.&nbsp; The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>You know anyone's who's taken it?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>That poet, Norther Winslow did.&nbsp; He was going to Paris, France.&nbsp; He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.</p><p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p><p>Tell you what.&nbsp; You take the other way and I'll cut through here.&nbsp; Meet you on the far side.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A little paranoid...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>You're not trying to run away?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Just to be sure, you can take my pack.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; DIRT ROAD - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.&nbsp; The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's a day meant for whistling.</p></div>
<h6>EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH</h6>
<div class="action"><p>The road has narrowed to a rough path.&nbsp; Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.&nbsp; Still, Edward WHISTLES.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.&nbsp; He stops.&nbsp; For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.&nbsp; The forest is dead quiet.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He looks back the way he came.&nbsp; It's tempting to go back.&nbsp; It would be easier to go back.&nbsp; But Edward presses on.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He carefully steps through the thorns.&nbsp; His trouser legs catch on the barbs.&nbsp; We can hear the fabric TEAR.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>FURTHER ALONG</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.&nbsp; Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You stupid sonofa...</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.&nbsp; The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST.&nbsp; The swarm roars out.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A half-broken sign lies in the road.&nbsp; Edward picks it up.&nbsp; Reads it:</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>WARNING!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>JUMPING SPIDERS!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake.&nbsp; The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.&nbsp; One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.&nbsp; Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.&nbsp; Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; THE TOWN OF SPECTRE&nbsp;  - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>It's a main street with stores on each side:&nbsp; Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store.&nbsp; Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town.&nbsp; In fact, there's a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.&nbsp; Most are smiling.&nbsp; There are even a few tears of joy.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>What's more, all of these people are barefoot.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MAN'S VOICE</p><p>Friend!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.&nbsp; Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor.&nbsp; He's carrying a clipboard.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Welcome to ya.&nbsp; What's your name?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Edward Bloom.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Beamen checks the clipboard.&nbsp; Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages.&nbsp; Still looking...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Bloom like a flower?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Yes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; Here!&nbsp; Right here.&nbsp; Edward Bloom.&nbsp; We weren't expecting you yet.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Still confused...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You were expecting me?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Not yet.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MILDRED</p><p>You must have taken a shortcut.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I did.&nbsp; It nearly killed me.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Mmm-hmm.&nbsp; Life'll do that to you.&nbsp; And truthfully, the long way <u>is</u> easier, but it's longer.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MILDRED</p><p>Much longer.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>And you're here now, and that's what matters.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>What is this place?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>The town of Spectre.&nbsp; Best kept secret in Alabama.&nbsp;  Says here you're from Ashton, right?&nbsp; Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>The poet?&nbsp; What ever happened to him?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>He's still here.&nbsp; Let me buy you a drink.&nbsp; I'll tell you all about it.&nbsp; Hell, I'll have him tell you.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>No.&nbsp; I've gotta meet somebody.&nbsp; I'm already running late.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Son, I already told you.&nbsp; You're early.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp;  BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie.&nbsp; He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>It truly is.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>UNDER THE TABLE</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NORTHER WINSLOW</p><p>Everything here tastes better.&nbsp; Even the water is sweet.&nbsp; Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.&nbsp; At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes.&nbsp; She races for the door.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Hey!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He chases after her.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together.&nbsp; Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw.&nbsp; There's no way he's ever getting them down.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.&nbsp; The women hug him.&nbsp; Men shake his hand.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Still focused on his shoes...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Wait!&nbsp; I need those!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NORTHER WINSLOW</p><p>There is no softer ground than town.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you've never met.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; UNDER A TREE - DUSK</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward sits with Norther Winslow.&nbsp; The fireflies are out.&nbsp; Thousands of them.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>A man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting.&nbsp; My journey had scarcely begun, and I had arrived.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NORTHER WINSLOW</p><p>There's a lot of expectation.&nbsp; I don't want to disappoint my fans.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A beat.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>It's only three lines long.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Norther grabs his notebook back.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">NORTHER WINSLOW</p><p>This is why you don't show work in progress.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Norther doesn't answer.&nbsp; Just goes back to his notebook.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; BY THE RIVER - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp; The Key to the City dangles around his neck.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He stares at himself in the reflection.&nbsp; He smiles.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.&nbsp; No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.&nbsp; We never see her face.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.&nbsp; Edward is breathless.&nbsp; It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Then he sees the snake.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>It's a cottonmouth, has to be.&nbsp; It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.&nbsp; There's no decision to be made.&nbsp; On pure instinct, Edward dives in.&nbsp; He swims as hard as can,</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>GRABBING THE SNAKE</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>just as it's about to strike.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>No, it's okay!&nbsp; I got it.&nbsp; I got the snake.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.&nbsp; Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick.&nbsp; And a non-threatening one at that.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.&nbsp; He never even saw her face.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>Wait!&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; Hello?!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does.&nbsp; He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.</p></div>
<h6>EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS</h6>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)</p><p>There's leeches in there!</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>What did she look like?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Well, she...uh...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>Was she nekkid?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Embarrassed to admit it...</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p class="parenthetical">(matter-of-fact)</p><p>It's not a woman, it's a fish.&nbsp;  No one ever catches her.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow up on the issue.&nbsp; He starts to wade back to the bank.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY (CONT'D)</p><p>Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent people.&nbsp; My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Shoot.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>I'm eight.&nbsp; That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28.&nbsp; And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.&nbsp; And that's not much difference at all.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Eager to get off this subject...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Sure is a lot now, though, huh?</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; MAIN STREET - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" has been transformed.&nbsp; Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.&nbsp; Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.&nbsp; From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.&nbsp; Still, he's having a blast.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.&nbsp;  Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward.&nbsp; It's hard to hear over the MUSIC.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MILDRED</p><p>Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.&nbsp; We all do.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p class="parenthetical">(not hearing)</p><p>What?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MILDRED</p><p>I said you're quite a catch!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward stops dancing.&nbsp; A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd.&nbsp; Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I have to leave.&nbsp; Tonight.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>Why?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>This town is everything a man could ask for.&nbsp; And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky.&nbsp; But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p>No one's ever left.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>How are you gonna make it without your shoes?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I suspect it will hurt a lot.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>And with that, Edward walks down Main Street.&nbsp; The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">BEAMEN</p><p class="parenthetical">(calling after him)</p><p>You won't find a better place!</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>Promise me you'll come back.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I promise.&nbsp; Someday.&nbsp; When I'm really supposed to.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>It's not good enough, but it will have to do.&nbsp; Edward keeps walking.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>VARIOUS SHOTS:&nbsp;  Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet.&nbsp; It's horrible.&nbsp; Almost unendurable.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>And then it gets worse.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The trees ahead are moving.&nbsp; At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it:&nbsp; they're trying to block him.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.&nbsp; He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches.&nbsp; He swings off, lands and rolls.&nbsp; Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.)</p><p>As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually.&nbsp; After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught.&nbsp; He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks.&nbsp; The silver key disappears into the mud.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.&nbsp; But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p><p>And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>With a sudden calm...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p class="parenthetical">(aloud)</p><p>This isn't how I die.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been.&nbsp; Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain.&nbsp; And LAUGHING.</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; THE ROAD - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>His bare foot steps onto asphalt.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">A DEEP VOICE</p><p>Friend!</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">KARL</p><p>What happened to your shoes?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>With that, the men start walking down the larger road.</p></div>
<div class="transition">CROSSFADE TO:</div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; DINING ROOM - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle.&nbsp; Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it.&nbsp; He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating.&nbsp; Will finally breaks the silence.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Really!&nbsp; That's wonderful.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>I spent a week in Morocco for the story.&nbsp; It was incredible.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>We'll have to pick up a copy.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>A beat.&nbsp; As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks:</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I don't know if you're aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>All three stop to listen.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p class="parenthetical">(amused)</p><p>Really.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You're lucky to get four words out of them in English.&nbsp; But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French.&nbsp; Those parrots talk about everything:&nbsp; politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Taking the bait...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Why not religion, Dad?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>It's rude to talk about religion.&nbsp; You never know who you're going to offend.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Yes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>How is that possible?&nbsp; I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.</p><p class="parenthetical">(decidedly)</p><p>You can't honestly say you know him.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Yes, Will, I do.&nbsp; And don't presume things you don't know.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous territory.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA (CONT'D)</p><p>Would you say you understand Josephine?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; But that's a different...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>No it's not.&nbsp; It's exactly the same.&nbsp; Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level.&nbsp; Just the same as you two.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>She moves on to the carrots.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>Josephine and I have a lot in common.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>True.&nbsp; But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all.&nbsp; Or ever will.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>I know it's not easy.&nbsp; Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son.&nbsp; You just ended up together.&nbsp; You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same.&nbsp; If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>But I understand you, Mom.&nbsp; I always have.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Well, clearly you don't.&nbsp; But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.</p></div>
<h6>INT.&nbsp; AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons.&nbsp; Will is approaching with a Newsweek magazine.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's is getting her change.&nbsp; Though she's Sandra's generation, she carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans and sneakers.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes.&nbsp; We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra.&nbsp; It's hard to read her reaction:&nbsp; does she recognize him, or just find him attractive?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will notices the gaze.&nbsp; The woman turns away.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">SANDRA</p><p>Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through.&nbsp; I wouldn't know what's important.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Sandra looks.&nbsp; After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, semi-casually.&nbsp; Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">WILL</p><p>No.&nbsp; But it's weird.&nbsp; She seemed to recognize me.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner.&nbsp; Turned low, the RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, just a wash of background chatter.&nbsp; Edward lies asleep on his back.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade.&nbsp; She reaches over Edward to switch off the radio.&nbsp; He stirs from the silence -- he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over him.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JOSEPHINE</p><p>That's terrible.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.&nbsp; Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die."&nbsp; Well, I ran right back to my parents.&nbsp; My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation.&nbsp; And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD (CONT'D)</p><p>For the next couple weeks, I didn't have another dream.&nbsp; Until one night the crow came back and said, "Your Daddy is going to die."</p><p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p><p>Well, I didn't know what to do.&nbsp; But finally I told my father.&nbsp; And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.&nbsp; That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.&nbsp; Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words:&nbsp; your Daddy is going to die.&nbsp; Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.&nbsp; And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.&nbsp; He said to my mother, "Good God.&nbsp; I just had the worst day of my life."</p><p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p><p>"You think <u>you've</u> had a bad day," she said.&nbsp; "This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!"</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously.&nbsp; His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why:&nbsp; he's holding it in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth.&nbsp; The beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin.&nbsp; If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Entwined, they roll across the dirt.&nbsp; The other nearby CARNIES scatter for cover.&nbsp;  Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit.&nbsp; Loads a silver bullet.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon.&nbsp; He finds only a small stick.&nbsp; He waves it at the dog, ready to strike it.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes.&nbsp; It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can.&nbsp; The dog bounds after it,</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet.&nbsp; Its tail whips back and forth.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was standing in profile.&nbsp; Ping is one-half of</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>SIAMESE TWINS.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all this time.&nbsp; They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving.&nbsp; The curtain slowly lowers, revealing</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it.&nbsp; The crowd APPLAUDS.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>You can use it to point out important information.&nbsp; Or dangers.&nbsp; Or beautiful women.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>"Welcome to Spectre."</p></div>
<h6>EXT.&nbsp; MAIN STREET - DAY</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction.&nbsp; He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY (V.O.)</p><p>A man sees things differently at different times in his life.&nbsp; This town didn't seem the same now that he was older.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching.&nbsp; Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY (V.O.)</p><p>Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough.&nbsp;  One wanted to open a chicken processing plant.&nbsp; The other, a municipal dump.&nbsp; Either way, Spectre would be destroyed.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY (V.O.)</p><p>Most of them had never seen Spectre -- they only had Edward's words to describe it.&nbsp; That's all they needed.&nbsp; He sold them on the dream.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.&nbsp; You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>So I've heard.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I'll offer you more than it's worth.&nbsp; And you know you won't have to move.&nbsp; Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished.&nbsp; She turns to face him.&nbsp; Edward still doesn't recognize her.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>Now let me get this straight.&nbsp; You'll buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it.&nbsp; You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine.&nbsp; I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.&nbsp; Do I have that right?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Strange to hear it put that way, but --</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>In so many words, yes.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom.&nbsp; If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>It's not like you're going to lose anything.&nbsp; You can ask anyone in town.&nbsp; I've been nothing if not generous.&nbsp; I want the best for everyone.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land?&nbsp; Some sort of midlife crisis?&nbsp; Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.&nbsp; No one has really asked before.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>Helping people makes me happy.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JENNY</p><p>I'm not convinced you should be happy.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">EDWARD</p><p>I'm sorry.&nbsp; Have I offended you?</p></div>
