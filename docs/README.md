## Welcome to Untitled VR Script

This project is a working progress VR script as part of a Masters Degree program at [AFDA](https://www.afda.co.za/) I set out to understand how storytelling would work in the VR medium. In my thesis I explore the topic of emergent storytelling. This is my attempt to write a VR script to outline such a story.

### The story

Through the actions and decisions of the participant, he/she will drive narrative and a unique story should emerge. The participant enters the world as a character who wakes up one morning and finds he cannot interact with his environment. He cannot pick up, move, or physically interact with the world. However, he can communicate and navigate the space.
